# SLOBsinglevortex_timeseries
This set of codes solves Boussinesq Equations in a triply-periodic domain. They are adjusted to the problem of a single barotropic vortex interacting with a travelling inertial wave. The computations are minimised to derive the time series at three points (or more) in physical space. All other diagnostics are kept to minimum. Real Space slices are removed for further efficiency.
